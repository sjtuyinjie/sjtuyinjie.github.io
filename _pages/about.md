😄 Hi, I'm Jie Yin, graduated from [Shanghai Key Laboratory of Intelligent Sensing and Navigation](https://ast.sjtu.edu.cn/web/index)(导航与感知所) of **[Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/)(上海交通大学)** with a bachelor degree in 2021 and with a master degree in 2024. 

🚀 My current research interests include Robotic learning, Embodied AI and Multi-sensor Fusion.

⭐️ My work have been accepted to top conferences/transactions on robotics/navigation such as **ICRA, IROS, RAL, CVPR, GPS Solutions** and so on. My highlighted projects include [**🔥M2DGR**](https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/M2DGR), [**🔥Ground-Fusion**](https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/Ground-Fusion), [**🔥DAF**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11333), [EN-SLAM](https://github.com/DelinQu/EN-SLAM),[Ground-Challenge](https://github.com/sjtuyinjie/Ground-Challenge), [Sky-GVINS](https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/Sky-GVINS) and so on, from which I received **over 1.7k github stars**. 

🚩 Previously, I used to research at **[MIT-IBM Watson Lab](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/), [HKU Mars Lab](https://github.com/hku-mars), [Tencent Robotics X Lab](https://roboticsx.tencent.com/#/), [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) and [Shanghai Beidou Research Institute](http://www.bdi.org.cn/)**. Now I'm working as a research engineer on embodied AI at a robotics startup.
